# ![nurl Icon](https://github.com/EdgeDLT/nurl/blob/main/icons/icon48.png) nurl

current version: v0.2.4

## Description

nurl is a browser extension which can resolve decentralized `.neo` domains into traditional web domains.

## How to Use

To navigate using a `.neo` domain, simply type the `.neo` domain into your address bar, appending a trailing slash `/` at the end. For instance, entering `status.edge.neo/` will take you to a node status page.

The domain must have a valid Neo Name Service CNAME record pointing at a traditional web domain. View the NeoNS docs for help setting up records.
